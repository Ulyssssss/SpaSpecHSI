## SpaSpecHSI
Joined spatial and spectral segmentation of hyperspectral datasets on historical art objects. 

## Codes
Matlab codes are available. Three spectral clustering options are provided:
- `Superpixel_HCA.m`: SLIC superpixel combined with Hierarchical clustering.
- `Superpixel_FCM.m`: SLIC superpixel combined with Fuzzy c-means clustering.
- `Superpixel_GMM.m`: SLIC superpixel combined with Gaussian mixture models.

## Data
One small dataset acquired on mockup painting is provided to test the code. 
- `mock-up.JPG`: RGB image of entire mockup painting
- `data-training.JPG`: Ground truth of training data
- The HSI data and associated RGB images are available in both .mat and .bip format.
- `wavelength.mat`: Wavelength matrix of HSI data
- Results generated by the codes are provided in /answers
